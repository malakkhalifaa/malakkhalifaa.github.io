Hey! I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto and I love building things, whether it’s low-level hardware, embedded systems, or playing around with artificial intelligence. I love exploring how tech can be used creatively. I’m a huge fan of [Gilmore Girls](https://www.vogue.com/article/22-and-just-watched-gilmore-girls-for-the-first-time), I've watched it 12 times.
 You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
